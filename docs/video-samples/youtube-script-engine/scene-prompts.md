# Video Generation Prompts (Sample)

Use these prompts in an AI video generator (Runway/Pika/HeyGen/etc.) scene by scene.

## Scene 1 (0:00-0:12)
Modern creator workspace, laptop with script draft, smooth camera push-in, soft daylight, clean desk, cinematic but minimal, subtle motion graphics text: "10x YouTube Script Generation".

## Scene 2 (0:12-0:28)
Split-screen style visuals showing three trending video thumbnails and analytics-like overlays, creator highlighting hook lines with markers, energetic but clean.

## Scene 3 (0:28-0:44)
Close-up of AI chat interface generating three hook options labeled Curiosity, Contrarian, Authority, animated text reveal, blue-violet accent palette.

## Scene 4 (0:44-1:00)
Productivity dashboard view with structured outline cards: Hook, Value Points, Proof, CTA; cards animate into place in sequence.

## Scene 5 (1:00-1:16)
Fast montage: text clarity edits in AI assistant, then thumbnail concept generation board with three visual styles, sharp modern transitions.

## Scene 6 (1:16-1:30)
Final result board with checklist completed: hooks, final script, CTA options, thumbnail text ideas; confident end frame with CTA: "Build once. Repeat weekly.".
